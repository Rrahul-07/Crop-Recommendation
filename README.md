# Crop-Recommendation
The crop recommendation system leverages machine learning to analyze factors like soil type, temperature, rainfall, and pH levels to suggest optimal crops for specific conditions. Using a trained model, it predicts the best crops for maximizing yield and sustainability, helping farmers make informed decisions and improve agricultural productivity.
